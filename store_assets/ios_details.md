## iOS Specific Information

Can be used with any Mac via USB, Bluetooth Midi or WiFi. Usage with PC is limited to WiFi with free third-party software (rtpMidi), and USB with third-party USB midi connectors, due to Apple's limited implementation of USB Midi on iOS.

AUv3 is unfortunately not supported at this time, as it is currently impossible with Flutter. More info about that here: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/16092
